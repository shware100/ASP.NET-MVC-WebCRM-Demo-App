This small app was developed to test out MS MVC and EntityFramework 6 for a simple business application like CRM.  There's nothing fancy about this application and the user interface is very basic.  Additional functionality may be added, time permitting.

This app is NOT production-quality. The code was developed for proof-of-concept only. Feel free to download, cut it up, use parts of it in any way desired.
